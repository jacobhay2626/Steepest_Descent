# Steepest_Descent
Using Steepest Descent to fit a Gaussian model to a distribution of heights dataset. 

### DISCLAIMER
This project is not completely original and I used a lot of my notes and understanding from online resources. \
My goal is to use the concepts in this notebook in my own, original work but wanted to have this in my portfolio regardless!
